## ABOUT

`>_ softskills`

> Seasoned dev, with 12+y experience on diverse technical and business contexts. Lover of architecture and _serious tooling_, to enable the best developer workflow possible.

> Throughout my career, I've taken the _Ownership_ concept as my motto - being accountable for your piece among the whole of a project encourages us to think through the whole development life cycle and deliver our best.
>
> Project standards, observability with relevant metrics, development process, in short: these are some of the things I like to keep my eye on. Being involved in the software development life cycle as a whole.
